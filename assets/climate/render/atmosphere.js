// How much of the sky the deck should actually *hide*.

// through it, because most of that cover is thin and broken: shallow cumulus
// over warm ocean, cirrus you can read a coastline through. Drawing 0.67 as
// 0.67 of solid white gave every temperate world a permanent overcast.
//
// What makes a deck genuinely opaque is water in the air, and that is a steep
// function of temperature. Measured from the model: temperate Earth carries
// about 0.011 bar of vapour, 300 K carries 0.027, a humid 315 K carries 0.055,
// and by 339 K it is 0.17 -- towelling-thick, the tropical-storm look, and by
// then the surface really should be hard to see. Beyond that the runaway takes
// over and `steam` covers the planet outright.
//
// So: about seven-tenths weight at temperate humidity, full weight by 0.15 bar.
// The number was picked by looking, because the shader's threshold makes this
// far from linear -- Earth's 0.67 drawn straight is a near-total white-out with
// the continents lost under it, 0.48 is scattered weather with the ocean
// showing through, and 0.33 is a bald planet with almost no cloud at all. The

// own cross-section has two hundred kilometres of liquid water and a thousand
// of supercritical steam between that rock and the sky.

// past the critical point -- the model's one definition of "no sea surface",
// shared with the vapour ceiling and the classifier. `steam` is how opaque the
