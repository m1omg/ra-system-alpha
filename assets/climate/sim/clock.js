// The clock. Physics advances on *simulated* time only.
//
// A frame hands the simulation however many simulated years elapsed; those
// years go into a credit account. Steps are then taken at a size chosen purely
// from the state of the planet (small while something is changing, up to
// millions of years while it is quiet), and a step is only taken when there is
// enough credit to pay for it in full. Because the step sequence never depends
// on where frame boundaries fell, 15 fps, 60 fps and a 500 ms stall all trace
// exactly the same trajectory.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// How much the climate may change per wall-clock second while the auto-ease
// governor is on, as a FRACTION of the temperature rather than in kelvin.
//
// Kelvin per second was the obvious unit and it does not work, because the two
// events this exists for are not the same size. A snowball is a thirty-kelvin
// fall and a runaway greenhouse is a seven-hundred-kelvin climb, so any fixed
// number of degrees a second either flicks past the first or takes two minutes
// over the second. In log temperature they are 0.14 and 1.2 -- within a factor
// of nine of each other -- and 5%/s puts the glaciation in about three seconds
// and the runaway in about twenty-five.
const EASE_TARGET = 0.10;      // |d ln T| per wall-clock second

// Measured, because the number above is not the whole story. At ten Myr a
// second a runaway greenhouse goes from temperate to boiling in 0.05 s of wall
// clock with this off and 2.8 s with it on; a glaciation goes 0.02 s to 1.3 s.
// Both are rate-independent -- asking for a hundred Myr a second gives the same
// 2.8 s -- and a settled Earth is untouched, running its full hundred million
// years in six hundred frames with the governor armed.
//
// 2.8 s is a floor rather than the target, and lowering EASE_TARGET does not
// move it: maxStep has bounds of its own that a smaller requested step does not
// get under. Ninety times slower is the feature working; getting the last
// factor of nine means arguing with the step-size estimator, which is a
// different job than this one.
