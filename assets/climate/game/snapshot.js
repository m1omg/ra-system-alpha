// the export file, and going back along a world's own history. Saving only the
// sliders would give you a planet that looked right and had forgotten
// everything it had been through, which for a model whose whole subject is
// history is the wrong thing to keep -- so this is the clock, the band
// temperatures, where the water is, how much of the ice sheet has grown, what
// is left of the fossil reserve and of the carbon below.
//
// It lives in its own module rather than inside main.js because the property
// worth testing is that it is COMPLETE, and that test needs to build a world,
// capture it, put it back, and run both forward to see whether they agree. A
// field added to the world and forgotten here would not throw; it would quietly
// make every save and every rewind slightly wrong.
