// `brightening: 1` is the star's own Gough (1981) track rather than a flat rate,

// insolation on that curve -- the Archean's 0.77 S(+) is the Sun at 1.15 Gyr,
// Noachian Mars's 0.32 is Mars at 0.6, Way's Early Venus is 2.9 Gya. Running
// them on the real curve is what makes those two facts agree: the Archean now
// reaches exactly 1.000 S(+) at the present day and Noachian Mars exactly the
// 0.431 Mars gets, where the old flat 10%/Gyr overshot both by 7-14%.
// Venus has no dynamo and it is not unprotected.
//
// An unmagnetised planet with a thick ionosphere induces a magnetosphere of its
// own: the solar wind's field piles up against the conducting upper atmosphere
// and is held off above the neutral gas. It is why Venus, with no dipole at all,
// still has three and a half bar of nitrogen after four and a half billion years
// while Mars, also with none, has six millibars of anything. `magneticField` is
// the only control this model has over how much wind reaches the air, so this is
// that shielding expressed through it -- 0.02 lets 12% of the wind through,
// about eightfold protection, which is the modest figure an induced
// magnetosphere earns rather than the hundredfold a dipole like Earth's does.
//
// It is not a fudge, and it is not the fix I wanted either. The physical version
// -- shielding as a function of atmospheric column, in windExposure() -- was
// written, tested and cannot ship, because it protects Mars too. Noachian Mars
// starts at 4 bar in this model and its entire fate rides on non-thermal escape,
// so ANY column-based shielding saves it:
//
//     shielding    Venus boils at   Mars CO2 today

//     4x pTot          3.83 Gyr     1514.0 mbar   <- Venus right, Mars 75x out
//
// There is no window. The real defect is upstream of both: this model's
// non-thermal escape is some thousands of times the rate MAVEN and Venus Express
// actually measure, because it has been asked to strip Mars's four bar single
// handed when the literature attributes only about half a bar to escape and the
// rest to carbonate. Until Mars's carbon has somewhere else to go, the rate
// cannot come down, and while it is that high only a per-world number can tell
// the two planets apart. Recorded here so the next person does not re-run the
// scan.
//
// What it buys, measured: Early Venus stays temperate 15-23 C from 1.67 Gyr,
// tips at an age of 3.82 Gyr -- Venus's global repaving is dated to 3.852 -- and

  // The 310 m is kept as the water inventory rather than as a coastline, but the
  // land fraction is then set to make the *coverage* come out right too, and

  // world built at 290 K has to earn every metre of it, against a stable
  // buoyancy gradient, and at this distance from the star it never gets the
