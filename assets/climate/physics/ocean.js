//
// On a rocky world this is a question with a boring answer: the ocean is two
// and a half kilometres of liquid over rock, its density is 1000 kg/m^3 from
// top to bottom, and treating it as an incompressible film loses nothing worth
// having. That is what the rest of this model does and it is right to.
//
// On a water-rich sub-Neptune the same arithmetic returns a number that is not
// merely imprecise but meaningless. K2-18 b's water inventory, spread over its
// surface at 1000 kg/m^3, is fifteen thousand kilometres deep -- most of the
// way to the planet's centre. Water does not do that. Long before then the
// pressure passes a gigapascal and it freezes, not because it is cold but
// because it is squeezed: the high-pressure ices VI and VII are STABLE ABOVE
// ROOM TEMPERATURE, ice VII up to several hundred kelvin, and they are what a
// deep ocean actually stands on.
//
// So a Hycean ocean has a floor, and the floor is ice rather than rock. This
// module says where it is.
//
// It is a DIAGNOSTIC and nothing here feeds a reservoir. There is no vertical
// ocean grid in this model and inventing one would be a much larger change than
// the readout it serves; what these functions do is take the column the model
// already tracks and say what it must look like if water behaves the way water
// behaves. Classification and the readout consume it. Nothing integrates it.
