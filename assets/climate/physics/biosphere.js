//
// The `biosphere` control is a rate: how hard oxygenic photosynthesis is being
// run, and it is an input to the chemistry. This is a different question and it
// is an output -- given the climate this planet has, how much of it could be
// inhabited, and by what kind of thing.
//
// Two kinds, because on this planet's history there are two, and the boundary
// between them is the sharpest one biology has:
//
//   PROKARYOTES are almost unkillable. They need liquid water and a source of
//   electrons and very little else. The temperature record is Methanopyrus
//   kandleri at 122 C under pressure; the cold record is metabolism in brine
//   films at -20 C and below. They do not need oxygen -- most of Earth's
//   history had none -- and they do not need light, because chemolithotrophs
//   in the deep subsurface make a living off rock and water. On Earth they
//   appeared within a few hundred million years of there being an ocean and
//   have never once been absent since.
//
//   EUKARYOTES are not. They are aerobes: the mitochondrion is the whole point
//   of them, and it burns oxygen. Nothing eukaryotic is known to complete its
//   life cycle without it. They are also far less thermotolerant -- the record
//   is a fungus at about 62 C, and most give up nearer 45 -- because their
//   membranes and their much larger genomes come apart sooner. And they were
//   late: the Great Oxidation is at 2.4 Gya, unambiguous eukaryotic fossils at
//   1.6, and the gap is not an accident of preservation. Building one takes an
//   endosymbiosis, which happened once.
//
// So a world can be teeming and have nothing on it more complicated than a
// bacterium, which is what Earth was for half its life, and that is the
// distinction this draws. Nothing here feeds back into the physics: it reads the
// climate and reports. Life that changed the climate would be the `biosphere`
// control, and that already exists.

// Oxygen a eukaryote needs, in bar. The lower bound is where aerobic
// respiration becomes worth having at all and the upper is where it stops being

// The prokaryote number is abiogenesis plus radiation, and on the one planet
// with data it is fast: pillow lavas and carbon isotopes put life at 3.8 Gya or
// earlier, within a few hundred million years of the ocean. The eukaryote
// number is the endosymbiosis, and on the same planet it is slow -- eight
// hundred million years of an oxygenated atmosphere before anything eukaryotic
// is unambiguous in the record.
//
// Recolonisation is far faster than origination in both cases, so the walk is
// asymmetric: a population that has somewhere to go gets there on an ecological
// timescale, and one that has to be invented waits.

// How long a population takes to disappear once it has nowhere left to live,
// which is NOT one number, because the two ways of running out of habitat are
// not alike.
//
// Ice advancing over a biosphere is a retreat into refugia -- brine channels in
// the sea ice, hydrothermal vents, the deep subsurface -- and Snowball Earth is
// the standing proof that it does not sterilise a planet: everything alive now
// came through one. Megayears is the right timescale for that, and it is what
// SPREAD was already doing.
//
// Heat has no refuge. Past about 400 K there is no known chemistry that holds a
// cell together, proteins denature in minutes, and the ocean is the thing doing
// the cooking -- there is nowhere to be that is cooler. This model was applying
// the refugia timescale to that case too, so a world whose ocean had reached
// 278 C read 100% prokaryote coverage, and went on reading it for a million
// years, because the population was relaxing towards zero with a 2 Myr time
// constant. The readout was not wrong about the room being zero. It was wrong
// about how long dying takes.
const HEAT_DEATH = 20;         // yr, once every band is well past the limit
const HEAT_MARGIN = 20;        // K past the ceiling for the full rate

// ...and the other half of that asymmetry: what a frozen world keeps.
//
// Under a kilometre of sea ice there is liquid water at the pressure-melting
// point, and under that there are hydrothermal vents, and neither of them cares
// what the surface is doing. Snowball Earth is the standing case -- the ice
// reached the equator, this model reads -56 C in its warmest band, and the
// biosphere came through it, which is why there is anything here to argue
// about. Scoring habitat off surface temperature alone said zero and then
// sterilised the planet over the following ten million years.
//
// Four percent is a token: small, out of sight, and not none. It is gated on
// there actually being an ice cover, so a world whose ocean is boiling rather
// than frozen gets nothing from it -- there is no refuge from heat.
//
// Prokaryotes only. Eukaryotes came through the Cryogenian too and this does
// not let them, which is a known simplification rather than a claim: a model
// with one number for "under the ice" cannot also say which of the two things
// living there was more fragile.

// This model scored habitability on temperature and liquid water alone, which
// makes heat the only thing that can kill a biosphere. The literature does not
// agree: as the Sun brightens, the carbonate-silicate thermostat answers by
// drawing CO2 DOWN, and photosynthesis stops when there is not enough of it
// left to fix. Every lifespan estimate of the complex biosphere since Lovelock
// & Whitfield 1982 has CO2 starvation, not overheating, as the kill mechanism
// on Earth's own track (Caldeira & Kasting 1992; Franck et al. 1999-2006;
// Rushby et al. 2018; Ozaki & Reinhard 2021; Graham et al.).
//
// The threshold is the CO2 compensation point -- the partial pressure below
// which a leaf respires away more carbon than it fixes. Older studies use
// 10 ppmv; C3 plants really sit between 30 and 100 ppmv depending on species
// and temperature, and C4 plants, which concentrate CO2 internally, get down to
// about 3. This model has one eukaryote population rather than two plant
// types, so one softened band stands in for both, and it is set by the C3
// range because C3 is most of the productivity: comfortable at 100 ppmv, gone
// at 10. Earth's 377 ppmv is clear of it and does not move; Earth at +1 Gyr,
// which this model settles at 59 ppmv, lands halfway down it -- a biosphere
// visibly going rather than one that is fine and then suddenly is not.
//
// Prokaryotes are deliberately exempt. Chemolithotrophs do not photosynthesise
// and the papers say so with numbers -- the complex biosphere is gone within
// 0.9 to 1.8 Gyr, while microbial life persists in refuges for something like
// 2.8 (O'Malley-James et al. 2013). Making CO2 kill both would erase exactly
// the gap between them that those two papers exist to describe.
