// A_CO2 sets the forcing per doubling, P_CO2 the amount at which the band core

// H2 is symmetric and has no permanent dipole, so on its own it has no

// the more of it there is, long after CO2 has gone logarithmic -- and it is why
// forty bar of it can hold a surface at 280 K ten astronomical units from a
// Sun-like star, where the sunlight is a hundredth of Earth's.
//
// Being a two-body process the absorption goes as the product of the two
// densities, and integrating that down a hydrostatic column gives

// three to ten Earth masses, and at twice Earth's gravity the same surface
// pressure stands over half the molecules. Every other opacity term in this
// file is written in pressures alone with g folded into a constant fitted at
// Earth's gravity, which is fine for a term anchored on Earth and wrong by a
// factor of two for one anchored on a super-Earth.
//
// Added AFTER the pressure-broadening factor rather than inside it, unlike the
// methane continuum above. That term is inside because it was fitted there, to
// Titan, and moving it would move Titan. This one is quadratic in pressure
// because the physics says quadratic; multiplying it by p^0.3 as well would

// single optical depth and no vertical coordinate at all; there is nowhere to
// put one, and drawing a temperature profile it does not solve would be a lie
// told in a comment. What it can carry is the CONSEQUENCE. An inhibited layer
// means the surface sits further below the radiating level than a moist adiabat
// would put it, so at a given outgoing flux the surface is hotter -- which is
// exactly what more optical depth does. So the parameterisation is a multiplier
// on tau, and it is a parameterisation of vertical structure this model does not
// resolve, stated as such here and in the README rather than buried.
//
// Gated three ways so it cannot reach any world that predates it: there must be
// hydrogen, it must be the background rather than a trace, and the air must be
// wetter than the criterion. Every world this model shipped with fails the
// first test, so the multiplier is exactly 1 and tau is untouched.
// One number, and it is NOT fitted to the inner edge, because the inner edge
// cannot be reached from here and finding that out is the most useful thing
// this phase produced.
//
// Innes, Tsai & Pierrehumbert 2023 put the 1 bar Hycean inner edge at 1.6 AU
// from a G star -- 0.391 S(+) -- where this model, with hydrogen but without
// inhibition, said 1.04. Turning the multiplier up closes that gap at a rate of
// about fourteen percent per doubling: 2.0 gives 0.70, 4.0 gives 0.60. Reaching
// 0.391 would take a multiplier near THIRTY-TWO on the total optical depth.
//
// That is not a parameterisation any more, it is a different model. A factor of
// thirty-two would make this term larger than every other opacity in the file
// put together, on a world where the only thing constraining it is the number
// it was bent to reproduce. So it is not done. The strength below is chosen on
// physical grounds -- superadiabatic layers in the Uranus and Neptune
// literature enhance the surface-to-radiating-level contrast by tens of
// percent, not by thirty-fold -- and the residual is reported as a GAP.
//
// The honest reading is the one the phase was designed to test: a semi-grey
// scheme with a single optical depth and no vertical coordinate cannot
// represent a superadiabatic layer, and multiplying tau is a shadow of one, not
// a substitute. It closes about forty percent of the gap. The rest of the gap
// is the missing vertical structure, and it stays visible.
//
// It was briefly two numbers. A second constant scaled the strength with
// envelope pressure, to reach for their 10 bar edge at 3.85 AU as well -- and
// it did nothing whatever, across a range of values that should have changed
// the answer threefold. The reason is in the criterion rather than in the code:
// q_inh is a MOLE FRACTION, so ten bar of hydrogen dilutes the same water ten
// times over and the threshold is simply not reached at the temperatures where
// that world's runaway peak sits. The criterion says a thick dry envelope is
// not inhibited, and it means it.
//
// So the knob came out. Shipping a fitted parameter that provably does not

// The cloud-albedo MINIMUM that makes a moist greenhouse abrupt -- and stable.
//
// Wolf & Toon 2015 (JGR Atmos. 120, 5775) run Earth under a brightening Sun in
// CAM4 and do not get a smooth curve: between +11.25% and +12.5% S0 the surface
// jumps 312.2 -> 331.9 K on three watts, and from there it climbs a STABLE moist
// greenhouse to 362.8 K at +21% with its ocean intact. Their cause: "the sharp
// transition ... was associated with MINIMA IN CLOUD ALBEDO and was caused by the
// CONVECTIVE STABILIZATION of warm atmospheres and subsequent DISSIPATION OF
// LOW-LYING CLOUDS."
//
// The word that matters is *minima*. A minimum falls and then comes back, and the
// two halves do different jobs. The fall is what makes the transition abrupt: the
// planet darkens as it warms, which is a positive feedback, and past some point
// it beats the outgoing flux and the lower branch stops existing. The RECOVERY is
// what makes the upper branch stable -- without it the albedo keeps falling, the
// feedback stays positive, and the world runs away instead of settling.
//
// A first attempt carried only the fall, as a single multiplier on cover. It
// warmed the hot end from 327 to 342.7 K and then refused to go further: every
// stronger setting ran away, because a stable root at 363 K needs d(OLR)/dT to
// beat the albedo feedback and it was 0.26 W/m^2/K against 0.58. That was not a
// tuning failure, it was the missing half of the mechanism.
//
// So there are two terms, and both are MONOTONE in the same variable:
//
//   cloudThinning   cover falls    -- the low deck dissipates
//   cloudDeepening  cloud brightens -- what convection is left is deep and thick
//
// Their product dips and recovers. Writing the minimum as two monotone functions
// rather than one non-monotone one is not presentation: `albAt` inside
// `radiativeDamping` differentiates this, and a sign change in a single term
// would put a discontinuity in the solver's Jacobian.
//
// The brightening uses ALB_CLOUD_DEEP, which is already in this file as the
// albedo of a deep convective tower and until now was reachable only by slow
// rotators piling a deck over their substellar point. A moist greenhouse is deep
// convective everywhere, so the same constant is the right ceiling; CLOUD_DEEPEN
// is how far toward it a fast rotator gets.
//
// Neither term enters `olr()`. `runawayLimit` brute-scans that function a kelvin
// at a time and a gated term inside it silently redefines the Simpson-Nakajima
// limit -- see the smoothing note above, which is the recorded failure. An albedo
// term is invisible to it, so that anchor is bit-identical by construction.

// is the wrong variable for the same reason the convective-inhibition gate

// the gate would fire on Earth-pressure worlds and nowhere else, which is a fit

// wrong -- a substellar band under half a bar of steam has lost its stratus
// whatever the rest of the planet is doing. But what Wolf & Toon report is a
// whole-atmosphere regime change, and a band gate cannot tell one from the
// other: the Eyeball's mean surface is 264 K with a frozen night side, and its
// substellar band alone carries 0.46 bar of vapour, so a per-band gate fired at
// full strength and warmed a shipped preset by 4.4 K. TRAPPIST-1e, at a mean of
// 195 K, does the same thing.
//
// The separating fact is not temperature and not the global mean vapour --
// measured, neither separates, because the Eyeball's mean vapour of 0.044 bar
// sits between a 10% and a 14% brighter Earth. It is that a moist greenhouse
// has no dry subsiding cold trap left ANYWHERE, poles included, while an
// eyeball is moist in one place and bone dry in the rest. So the gate is on the
// DRIEST band, and the numbers separate by three orders of magnitude:
//
//     driest band, bar        share
//     Earth today      0.0024   0.01     Eyeball       0.0000   0.00
//     Earth +10%       0.0086   0.91     TRAPPIST-1e   0.0000   0.00
//     Earth +11.25%    0.0102   1.00     Dune          0.0012   0.00
//     Earth +21%       0.0508   1.00     Mars, Venus   0.0000   0.00
//
// The window is those first two rows: 0.002 bar is what a present-day pole
// holds and 0.010 is what a 10% brighter one holds. The area share of bands
// over a threshold was tried first and is the wrong statistic -- the Eyeball's
// sunlit third scores 0.34 on it, which is not small enough, and a real moist
// greenhouse never scores 1 because its own poles stay the driest place on it.
//
// `min` is not differentiable, and `albAt` does differentiate through here. It
// is a kink rather than a jump -- a perturbation to band i moves the share only
