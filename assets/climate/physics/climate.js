// this branch there was no world with enough of it to show.

  // there bought 8x.

  // ways: the runaway arrives at 5 Myr on the relaxed steps and at 60-75 Myr
  // when the step is forced below 20 kyr. Fifteen times early, and the coarse
  // answer is the wrong one.
  //
  // The error in the argument is that this reservoir is a slow INTEGRATOR, and
  // what it integrates to is not what it is worth now. CO2 on that world is
  // inert at a millionth of a bar and ends up at forty-two bar, and it is the
  // accumulation itself -- while it is still radiatively nothing -- that has to
  // be integrated accurately, because the whole future depends on where it
  // gets to. A bound on the present radiative effect cannot see that coming.
  //
  // So: unchanged, deliberately, and the reason recorded so the next person to
  // measure that 0.015 W/m2 does not have to rediscover why it is not the
  // number that matters. (The same test also shows this world is not converged
  // at 20 kyr either -- 6e7 against 7.5e7 at 5 kyr -- so if anything the bound
