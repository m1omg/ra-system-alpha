// O2_BIO is then fixed by requiring an Earth-like biosphere over Earth-like

// fixed point.
//
// Natural budget, Saunois et al. 2020: ~218 Tg/yr, which lands 0.72 ppm at a
// ten-year lifetime.
//
// Nearly all of it goes on the biosphere, including the ~38 Tg/yr usually
// filed under "geological". Those seeps are thermogenic -- buried organic
// carbon cooked back out of sedimentary rock -- so they are biological methane
// on a delay, not something the interior would make on its own. A world that
// never had life has no source rock and gets none of it. What is left for the
// interior is the genuinely abiotic part, serpentinisation and mantle carbon at
// a couple of teragrams a year, some twenty times smaller.
//
// The distinction is not academic: put the seeps on the interior and every
// sterile volcanic world in the game grows an Archean methane greenhouse out of
// nothing, which is how this was caught.

// Present-day anthropogenic CO2 is about 40 Gt of CO2 a year, which over
// Earth's surface is 7.8e-2 kg/m^2/yr -- some forty times what all the world's
// volcanoes manage, which is the whole point.
//
// It is drawn from a finite reservoir, and that matters more than the rate.
// Fossil carbon is not a tap: recoverable coal, oil and gas together come to
// something like 5000 Gt of carbon (Lenton & Cannell 2002; Archer 2005 uses the
// same figure as the upper bound), which is 36 kg/m^2 of CO2, or about
// thirteen times the pre-industrial atmospheric column. At today's rate that is
// four and a half centuries and then it stops, whatever the slider says.
//
// Without the reservoir the control would be an infinite source and every world
// with it switched on would simply run away given long enough, which is not
// what burning the Earth's fossil carbon does. What it does is spike the CO2
// and then hand it to the carbonate-silicate thermostat, which takes it back
// over a hundred thousand years or so -- the long thaw.
// The rest of what an industrial civilisation puts in the air, which is not a
// footnote: CO2 is 2.16 W/m^2 of the 2019 forcing against 1750 and everything
// else together is another 1.16 (IPCC AR6 Table 7.8). Three components, and
// they are kept apart because they behave completely differently.
//
//   METHANE, 0.54 W/m^2, goes into the methane reservoir that already exists
//   rather than being lumped, because the model has the gas and knows what to
//   do with it -- including its shortwave absorption and its ten-year life.
//   Anthropogenic methane is about 360 of the 580 Tg/yr Earth emits, against
//   the 218 Tg/yr natural budget CH4_BIO is anchored on, so it is 1.65x nature
//   at today's rate. This is what the CH4_BIO comment meant by "most of today's
//   methane is ours": until now the model had the natural budget and no us, so
//   a modern Earth relaxed to 0.72 ppm within a century. Now it holds 1.9.
//
//   NITROUS OXIDE AND THE HALOCARBONS, 0.62 W/m^2 between them, are lumped into
//   one effective forcing. Nothing is gained by resolving CFC-12 from HFC-134a
//   from SF6 here: they are all long-lived, well-mixed, and small enough that
//   what matters is the total and the timescale. 150 years is the mass-weighted
//   life of the mixture -- N2O is 116, the CFCs 45-100, SF6 three thousand.
//
//   SULPHATE AEROSOL, and this one cools: -1.1 W/m^2, which is why the planet
//   has warmed 1.3 K and not 2.4. It is emitted by the same combustion and it

//   accumulating -- and that asymmetry is the whole reason it is worth
//   modelling. Stop burning and the aerosol is gone within the decade while the
//   gases stay for centuries, so the planet gets warmer before it gets cooler.
//   That is the termination shock, and with only CO2 in the model there was no
//   way to see it.
//
// The three very nearly cancel to the CO2-only answer at today's rate, which is
// why this could be added without moving the calibration: +0.54 and +0.62
// against -1.1. What it changes is everything away from today's rate.

// (metal-silicate partitioning studies; Dasgupta & Hirschmann 2010 for the deep
// cycle). Rather more is dissolved in the core, and none of that is coming back.
//
// As CO2 over Earth's surface that is 4.1e6 kg/m^2, or about 400 bar. Two
// independent routes agree: Earth's carbon inventory is put at 2.5e22 mol and
// possibly as high as 1e23, which is 210 to 850 bar, and the mass fraction lands
// in the middle of that. The uncertainty is real and it is roughly a factor of
// two either way; this is a floor-to-ceiling number, not a precise one.
//
// The scaling with planet mass is the honest part. Carbon is a roughly constant
// fraction of the silicates for worlds that accreted from similar material, so
// the inventory follows the mantle mass, and what matters to an atmosphere is
// the column -- inventory over area. That is why the number below divides by
// r^2: a bigger planet has more carbon and less surface to spread it over.
//
//     Mars       0.107 M(+)      51 bar        actual atmosphere 0.006 bar

// its volcanism and then its atmosphere. Neither needed a different carbon
// endowment to end up where it is, which is the useful thing this says.
//
// What is deliberately *not* modelled: formation distance and disk C/O, which
// shift the endowment by a factor of a few; core mass fraction, which changes

// high-pressure ice changes is the delivery path to the atmosphere.
//
// The older picture -- ice VI/VII as a sealed lid, rock and ocean out of
// contact -- is the one the literature has spent the last decade dismantling,
// and a hard zero here would be an overclaim in that direction:
//
//   Kalousova & Sotin 2018 (GRL 45, 8096): ice melts at the silicate interface
//   when convection is weak, and the melt rises to the ocean efficiently. It is
//   vigorous convection that cools the interface below melting and shuts the
//   path down, and the path narrows as the shell thickens with age.
//
//   Hernandez et al. 2022 (Nat Commun 13, 3303): up to 2.5 wt% NaCl dissolves
//   in dense ice at mini-Neptune interior conditions, and thermo-compositional
//   convection carries it across -- plumes of salty ice melting at the ocean
//   boundary, crystallisation at the bottom returning salt downward. Their
//   conclusion is that the mantle is permeable, not that it is a barrier.
//
// So this is a throttle whose one honest justification is thickness: efficient
// through a thin shell, progressively slower through a thick one, never zero.
//
// It is also lumping in two things the model cannot represent separately, and
// both push the same way for ATMOSPHERIC carbon specifically, which is a
// narrower question than the nutrient transport those papers are about. A
// Hycean ocean is hundreds of kilometres deep and is an enormous dissolved-
// carbon buffer that this model has no reservoir for; and Nakayama et al. 2019
// (arXiv:1907.00827) find seafloor weathering on ocean planets *enhanced* by
// high-pressure ice melting, a sink rather than a source. Carbon reaching the
// ocean floor is a long way from carbon reaching the sky.

// mixing heat downward against a stable buoyancy gradient." Hot fluid sits on
// cold fluid and stays there. Nothing carries the heat down but the small
// fraction of the energy that stratified turbulence manages to move.
//
// Coming back up there is no such difficulty. A cooling supercritical layer
// gets denser as it cools, so it sinks and condenses on its own, and the only
// thing rationing the retreat is how fast the planet can radiate the enthalpy
// away. So the mixing efficiency is the whole asymmetry: MIX_EFF_DOWN going in,
// 1 coming out, one number rather than two invented timescales, and the
// hysteresis falls out of it instead of being asserted.
