// How the same star's XUV output falls as it spins down.

// analogues at F_XUV ~ t^-1.23, which makes the Sun at half a billion years
// something like fifteen times as harsh in the extreme ultraviolet as it is
// now, and a hundred times at a hundred million.
//
// This matters far more than the bolometric brightening for anything to do with
// escape: the wind and the XUV track each other, and both are what strip an
// unprotected atmosphere. Mars lost its air while the Sun was still young.
// ...but not from birth. A young star rotates fast enough that its dynamo is
// running flat out, and the XUV ratio saturates: it cannot climb any further no
// matter how much faster the star spins (Wright et al. 2011, log Lx/Lbol ~ -3.1
// at Rossby numbers below ~0.13). The decline only begins once the star has spun
// down enough to leave that regime, and how long that takes is a property of the
// star, not a constant. Fully convective late M dwarfs shed angular momentum far
// more slowly than a G dwarf does.
//
// How long that lasts is MEASURED, not fitted to a convenient exponent. It was
// the exponent once -- 0.1 Gyr for the Sun times (T/T_sun)^-3.3 -- and the
// number that fell out for a late M dwarf, about 1.5 Gyr, was wrong by enough
// to contradict the observation the presets are anchored to.
//
// The contradiction is worth stating, because it is the kind a model can carry
// for a long time without anything going visibly wrong. TRAPPIST-1b and 1e
// carry a measured present-day XUV of 206x solar (Wheatley et al. 2017:
// Lx/Lbol = 2-4e-4, and more again in the EUV). Run that back up a t^-1.23
// curve to a saturation that ended at 1.5 Gyr and it implies the star used to
// be 843x solar -- almost six times the saturation ceiling of log(Lx/Lbol)
// ~ -3.3, which is a ratio no star exceeds because it is set by the dynamo
// running flat out. The curve was claiming a history the star could not have
// had. GJ 1132 b was over by four times.
//
// The resolution is that late M dwarfs stay saturated for far longer than that
// exponent allowed. West et al. (2008) measure activity lifetimes across the M
// sequence from 38 000 stars -- 0.8 Gyr at M0, 4.5 at M4, 8 at M7 -- and
// TRAPPIST-1 itself is still X-ray active at an age of 7.6 Gyr
// (Burgasser & Mamajek 2017 for the age). So the table is theirs, with the
// solar X-ray saturation timescale at the hot end, interpolated in log lifetime
// against effective temperature. A power law cannot fit it: the M sequence
// flattens between M5 and M6 and the fit through M4 and the fit through M7

// 10^24-10^25 particles a second); what differs is what that leak is measured
// against.
//
// It was implemented, as a shielding term linear in surface pressure, and it
// does what it should for Venus: Early Venus stopped losing fourteen fifteenths
// of its nitrogen in 1.5 Gyr and kept the lot. It also saved Mars. This model's

// nine-fold shielding at four bar being enough to do it. No function of
// pressure can give a four-bar Mars less protection than a one-bar Venus; only
// gravity can, and gravity is already carrying a fourth power here.
//
// What that really says is that this channel is being asked to do work that was
// not all its own. MAVEN's present rate integrated over four billion years is

// The two only differ by `startAge`, so a preset that wants a real date still
// gets one: Early Venus begins at 1.67 Gyr and asks for 2.182 elapsed, which is
// the same 3.852 Gyr of age it always meant.

// to 1.36 S(+) in small steps settles at 63 C with its ocean intact, and the
// same world dropped there in one jump overshoots into a 576 C steam greenhouse
// it cannot leave. Both are self-consistent; which one you get is decided by
// how fast the star changed, not by where it ended up.
//
// A slider is a jump. So with this on, typing a number or clicking the track
// sets a TARGET and the star walks to it -- which is the only way to reach the
// hot branch deliberately rather than by accident.
//
// Rate-limited rather than given a fixed duration, because the thing that must
// not be outrun is fractional: a tenth of a percent per hundred thousand years
// is gentle whether the star is at 0.3 S(+) or 30. That works out at about
// 36 Myr for the 36% change the hysteresis test uses, against the 32 Myr that
// test needed to stay on the branch.

// starlight control now spans a factor of a thousand. Walking from Earth's
// sunlight to GJ 1132 b's nineteen at 1e-8 a year is 300 Myr, which reads as a
// control that does nothing. So the rate is set from the size of the move: any
// change crosses in this long, and only the small ones -- where SMOOTH_RATE is
// already the faster of the two -- take less.
//
// Twenty million years is chosen against what the smoothing is for. The point
// is to keep the planet on its branch rather than throwing it across a
// bifurcation, and the slowest thing that has to keep up is the carbonate
// weathering feedback at about a million years. Twenty e-folds of margin.
