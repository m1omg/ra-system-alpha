// averaged over the globe, on a body six thousand kilometres across, and it
// changes the radius by nothing worth writing down. A sub-Neptune's is
// hundreds of kilometres deep and made mostly of high-pressure ice, and it is
// not a film on the planet -- it IS a layer of the planet, and the planet is
// visibly bigger for it. K2-18 b is 8.63 Earth masses and 2.61 Earth radii;
// the rocky relation above gives 1.79, which is not a small error, it is a
// different object.
//
// Where the line falls is not a matter of taste. `hypsometry.js` already says
// how much water a solid surface can hold before there is no basin left to hold
// it: MAX_BASIN_DEPTH, a deliberately generous full peak-to-trough relief for a
// rocky world. Water beyond that has nowhere on the surface to be, so it is
// interior water. On Earth that threshold is 7.3 oceans and every world this
// model shipped with carries at most six, which is why this term is exactly
// zero on all of them rather than merely small.

// First, 1/3.7 = 0.2703, which is the exponent this file has always used. The

// bit-for-bit what it went in as. That is what lets a mass-radius relation be
// added to a model of twenty-six terrestrial worlds without moving any of them.

// over a super-Earth is a rounding error on the planet's mass -- so folding it
// into the radius that sets surface gravity would be wrong twice over: it would
// weaken gravity that the gas does not actually weaken, and it would do it to
// every world with any atmosphere at all, Earth included. So the structural
// radius stays structural, this is reported alongside it, and the observational
// anchors compare against this one.
//
// How far up depends on the pressure ratio, not on a fixed count of scale
// heights. `render/atmosphere.js` draws five of them, which is a sensible place
// to stop a picture; it is not where a transit stops. A transit measures the
// altitude at which the slant path becomes opaque, conventionally taken near
// ten millibars for a hydrogen envelope, and how far that sits above the
// surface depends entirely on how deep the surface is: ln(p_surf/p_ref) scale
// heights. Ten bar of envelope puts it seven scale heights up, a thousand bar
// puts it eleven and a half. Using a fixed five would make a hundred-bar
// envelope and a ten-bar one look the same size, which is the opposite of what
