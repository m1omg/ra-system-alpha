It works only because there is too little water to move the heat: a wetter world would carry enough latent heat away from the substellar point to even the temperatures out, and would then cross the runaway limit as a whole planet instead of leaving a habitable band behind (Lobo et al. 2023).' },

Everything below that stays liquid. Europa carries roughly 13 km of ice over 100 km of ocean on tidal heat alone, and a snowball Earth keeps about a kilometre of ice over a live ocean on radiogenic heat. The surface is dead; the sea is not. Note that ice Ih melts COLDER under pressure, so the warmest place in the shell is the bottom of it.' },

  nightfrost: { name: 'Partial Nightside Freeze-Out', color: '#8c6fa8', blurb: 'The atmosphere is snowing out onto the dark side. A tidally locked world has a hemisphere that never sees its star, and if that face falls below the CO2 frost point the air condenses there permanently — no season ever brings it back, which is exactly what separates this from a Mars. The pressure falls until what is left balances against the night-side deposit, and the day side is still warm, wet and habitable while it happens: this is a planet with a working ocean under its sun and its atmosphere quietly draining away behind it. That sea is part of the state rather than a likely accompaniment to it — when the last of it goes the freeze-out is complete, and the world is a Nightside Freeze-Out. What stops it is heat transport. Thick enough air carries enough warmth to the night side to hold it above the frost point, so the collapse is self-limiting on a massive atmosphere and a trap for a thin one (Joshi et al. 1997; Wordsworth 2015; Turbet et al. 2018 for the TRAPPIST-1 planets).' },
  nightfrozen:{ name: 'Nightside Freeze-Out', color: '#6f6a8f', blurb: 'The collapse has finished. Most of the atmosphere is lying on the hemisphere that never sees the star as dry ice, and what water the planet has is frozen beside it — so there is no liquid water anywhere, and the day side is a bare desert under whatever thin remnant of air is left. It is the end state of a Partial Nightside Freeze-Out rather than a different mechanism, and the difference between the two is the sea: while there is one, the world is habitable and quietly losing its air behind it; once it is gone, there is nothing left to lose. Distinct from a Nightside-Trapped Desert, where the air is intact and only the water has migrated.' },
  titan:      { name: 'Titan-Like',         color: '#c9a86a', blurb: 'A frigid world under a thick nitrogen–methane haze, far too cold for liquid water but warm enough for other liquids to run on the surface.' },

  baked:      { name: 'Baked Desert',         color: '#e08a3a', blurb: 'A hot, waterless world of bare rock. Whatever water it had is long gone, so nothing moderates the surface and the day side simply bakes.' },

The envelope keeps the surface warm far outside a rocky planet\u2019s habitable zone: the worlds here sit at about a tenth of Earth\u2019s sunlight and are still temperate (Madhusudhan et al. 2021). What the literature also claims, and this model does not produce, is the hot end of the band \u2014 a stable ocean at 400 to 550 K. Here the hottest Hycean whose energy budget actually closes is 335 K and anything warmer runs away instead, because the stabiliser that holds the hot branch up is vertical structure a semi-grey scheme has nowhere to put. So this is the temperate Hycean, said plainly \u2014 and the reading of any real planet as Hycean at all is contested.' },

It needs the envelope to be thick: at these temperatures the greenhouse is doing all the work, and the ocean is liquid because of the pressure over it rather than because of anything the star does.

There is no equilibrium at any temperature and the sea is going into the sky \u2014 but there is more water here than the sky can take, so what is left is liquid, buried under steam or supercritical fluid, and cooler than the surface because heat has to be mixed down against a stable buoyancy gradient to reach it (Pierrehumbert 2023).

  // seventeen of hydrogen, and the state switched to `magma` while four hundred
  // and fifty Earth-oceans of liquid water were still sitting underneath it.
  //
  // So it is tested on the thing it actually claims, and the claim is not about
  // the surface: a runaway is under way, and there is still liquid water under
  // it. Requiring the SURFACE to be past the critical point was one particular

  // that makes this state worth having is the one whose sea is simply too big to
  // boil away. It cannot swallow a state that lasts: measured over a 0.5 to
  // 500 EO sweep, every one of these worlds ends with `hotLayer` at 1.000 and
  // nothing liquid anywhere -- the lid always reaches the bottom, so this is a
  // stage and not a trap. How long it takes scales with the inventory: 15 kyr
  // at half an ocean, 33 at one, 2.6 Myr at sixty, 23.6 at five hundred.

  //
  // No envelope requirement either. A cold-started waterworld with no hydrogen
  // at all buries its ocean the same way -- 60 EO at 1.6 S(+) spends 2.3 Myr

  // What replaced it was `unconverted > 0.02` -- how much of the column has NOT

  // too, for the reason written above `buriedOcean` below. Both of them were

  // `w.water.ocean` is the SURFACE sea. On a world being buried it empties into

  // has moved into the cold pool, which `coldPoolStructure` solves from the

  // as "97% not converted". So the state fell through to Steam Runaway
  // Greenhouse while the panel beside it drew 2.59 km of liquid ocean, and the
  // conversion it was calling finished had 97% of the column left to eat.
  //
  // Measured on Earth's Last Ocean: of 36 sampled frames with liquid drawn

  // The state lasted 1.5 kyr where the conversion takes about 35 -- which is
  // this model's own number, the 45 kyr for 1 EO that calibrate reports.

  // and reports zero -- which is the distinction the comment above wanted and

  // last: `covered` is false on everything that is not in a runaway, the
  // surface test short-circuits it on everything that still has a sea, and on
  // what is left the readout is already solving that column to draw it.
  // Whichever column describes the water: `coldPool` under a lid, `oceanBase`

  // so a world that had been a Buried Ocean went back to being a Steam Runaway
  // with its ocean still there. Two ends of one state decided by two different
  // numbers is how the sequence came out as steam -> buried -> steam.
  //
  // Nothing is lost by dropping it. `poolLiquid()` already goes false on its
  // own, continuously, as the lid eats the pool: `coldPoolStructure` solves the

  // exactly when the conversion finishes. The other disjunct carries its own
  // unconverted water by construction -- a surface reservoir with 2% of the

  // one measurement, and it is the measurement the picture draws.
  //
  // `w.water.ocean > 0.02 * water` was the other disjunct and it is gone. It is
  // a RESERVOIR total, and the reservoir and the column can disagree about the
  // same water: on the reported world at 2.4 Myr the pool holds no liquid at all -- 1307 km
  // of ice VII at 138 C, solid from pressure rather than from cold -- while 2847 of 2986 oceans still sit in
  // `water.ocean`, so the state kept the name "a runaway with an ocean still
  // under it ... what is left is liquid" over a planet whose water is ice.
  // The same read-the-reservoir-not-the-column fault the entry gate had.
  //
  // ...and there has to be a LID. `covered` alone let an ordinary runaway --
  // Earth at 2.6 S⊕, forty years in, 415 K, 99% of its ocean still liquid and
  // `hotTarget` zero -- read as Buried Ocean, under a blurb about a hot layer
  // eating downward through water it cannot mix. That world has no such layer;
  // its sea is leaving through its own surface, which is the steam runaway
  // three states down. The paper's cold start (Pierrehumbert 2023 §4) is a hot
  // isothermal upper layer in contact with a cold liquid or ice boundary, and
  // `dg.lidded` is that layer: a hot target over the pool. The steam-over-sea
  // disjunct of `covered` is still what carries the name once the lid forms
  // over a world whose surface reservoir has emptied into the sky.
  //
  // Nothing about how much is left. A share-of-the-inventory term was tried
  // here to suppress the ninety years on Earth at 2.6 S⊕ between the lid
  // closing and the last half-kilometre of sea boiling under it, and it took
